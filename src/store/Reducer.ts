If you use analytics or advertising services, for example, you should make this clear and link to these third-party companiesâ€™ respective privacy policies.`,

    This is probably the most important section of your privacy policy as using this data to offer a better and more customized experience on your website is different than selling that data to third parties. If you have European users, this is also where you would specify the legal basis for the collection.
    
    If you are operating an eCommerce website, for example, you should specify that personal information will be used to process payments and ship products to customers. In that case, there is a good chance that their personal information may be processed by a third party: an online payment processing service provider or your shipping partner, for example. This should all be disclosed to your customers.`,

Include your email address, street address, and phone number, along with the contact details of your data protection officer if your website is subject to the GDPR.`,

You will want to study applicable laws as well as the terms and conditions of all the third-party services that you use, as some require that you have specific clauses in your policy.`,
